## Software Engineering:
1.  [MIT 6.005 Spring 2016 "Software Construction"](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-005-software-construction-spring-2016/index.htm)
    -   Introductory-level course for Java programming as well as Software Engineering.
    -   The instructor, Prof. Rob Miller has offered the same class on Edx in a two-course sequence:
        -   [Software Construction in Java](https://www.edx.org/course/software-construction-java-mitx-6-005-1x)
        -   [Advanced Software Construction in Java](https://www.edx.org/course/advanced-software-construction-java-mitx-6-005-2x)

## Operating System:
1.  [MIT 6.828 "Operating System Engineering" Fall 2014](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2014/schedule.html)
    -   [Class schedules, notes and assignments](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2018/schedule.html)
    -   [Video (first 3 lectures are missing)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfciLKR3SgqNJKKIKUliWoNBBH1VHL3AP)
    -   There is a recent version of 6.828 [link](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2018/schedule.html). However, its homework, assignments and notes look exactly the same as Fall 2014 one

2.  [Stanford CS 140 "Operating System" Spring 2018](http://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/cs140-spring18/index.php)
    -   [Class schedules and notes](http://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/cs140-spring18/lectures.php)
    -   [Assignments](http://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/cs140-spring14/projects.php)
    -   There is an equivalent, but experimental class [CSE 140e](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs140e/) which teaches the same material but assignments are in different language: Rust
